# Data Analysis Portfolio

Here are a few of my (very serious) past projects.



### :art: [Art Students Sociology](https://github.com/eloisedelerue/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/art-students-sociology)
A data analysis carried out from a questionnaire distributed to art students to determine whether their artistic practices are influenced by their social background.
Since the questionnaire did not receive many responses, the results are not very interesting; however, the modelling of the problem might be interesting.


### :meat_on_bone: [Cannibalism and Democracy](https://github.com/eloisedelerue/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/cannibalism-and-democracy)
A data analysis that studies at whether a country's regime has an influence on cannibalism.


### :ocean: [Flooding and Natation](https://github.com/eloisedelerue/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/flooding-and-natation)
A data analysis that investigates the link between GDP, flooding and a country's Olympic swimming medals.


### :headstone: [Kenny's Deaths](https://github.com/eloisedelerue/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/kenny-s-deaths)
A data analysis that explores whether the multiple deaths of Kenny's character in South Park truly reflect the fears of American society.
Please note that the report is missing, and will be added soon.


### :books: [Lightnovel Collection](https://github.com/eloisedelerue/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/lightnovels-collection)
A programme written for the purpose of collecting information about lightnovel works from the [lightnovelworld](https://www.lightnovelworld.com/hub_29071230#:~:text=Light%20Novel%20World%20is%20a%20very%20special%20platform%20where%20you) website.
