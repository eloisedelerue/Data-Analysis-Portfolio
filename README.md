# Data Analysis Portfolio

Here are a few of my (very serious) past projects.

### Art Students Sociology
A data analysis carried out from a questionnaire distributed to art students to determine whether their artistic practices are influenced by their social background.

### Cannibalism and Democraty
A data analysis that studies at whether a country's regime has an influence on cannibalism.

### Flooding and Natation
A data analysis that investigates the link between GDP, flooding and a country's Olympic swimming medals.

### Kenny's Deaths
A data analysis that explores whether the multiple deaths of Kenny's character in South Park truly reflect the fears of American society.

### Lightnovel Collection
A programme written for the purpose of collecting information about lightnovel works from the [lightnovelworld](https://www.lightnovelworld.com/hub_29071230#:~:text=Light%20Novel%20World%20is%20a%20very%20special%20platform%20where%20you) website.
